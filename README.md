My javascript pairs game project 
# My Portfolio - Project One

### About

For this project, I created a javascript pairs game. For this game, the user needs to click on two cards to reveal the images. If the images match, the images will stay on the sreen. If not, the images will disappear, awaiting to be flipped later. When all cards are flipped, the user will recieve an alert saying "you have won the game". 

Not only did I create this game, I also created a user-friendly website for my game. When the user enters the site, there is a simple landing page with a navigation bar that allows them to go to either an instructions page, or straight to playing the game. The landing page includes a logo for the game that I sourced from www.looka.com (listed in acknowledgements). The instruction page provides clear instructions for how to play the game. The user can then click on "play" in the navigation menu to play the game. The navigation menu makes it easy to go between home, instructions page and the game page. 

### Why this project?

This website aims to provide users with an easy game experience where the rules are simple and users can switch off from a long day and also test their memory skills. 

## UX

### Style Rationale 

I wanted to create a game that had a clean design and was easy to navigate. I used Unsplash.com to get the images and decided to go with bright, bold colours and images that went together but were also a little quirky and weird. For the rest of the game (the grid, background colour of the website etc) I went with a simple pastel colour palette using adobe colour.  

### Features
- **Navigation Bar Links** - The links are responsive and take you to the corresponding section. They are simple white text with a cursor change to allow the user to see clearly where they are clicking and also to let the user know to click the link
- **Main Landing Page** - The landing page is a simple logo taken from www.looka.com 
- **Instructions** - This section is a simple blue card with instructions on how to play the game. Down the bottom there is a "Let's go" link which takes you to the game and an "I'm too scared" link, in case you're too scared to play the game and might be better to instead play with a Benedict Cumberbatch name generator 
- **Play** - When you navigate to this page you will see a simple blue 4x4 grid with a shadow hover effect. This is the game! Enjoy!  

### Features Left to Implement

- **Sound** - For next steps, I would really like to add some music or some sound effects 


## Technologies Used and Acknowledgments

- **HTML5** - I used HTML5 for many of the basic foundations of my website
- **Bootstrap** - Alongside HTML5, I used Bootstrap classes to create the elements such as cards and navigation bars and to utilise the bootstrap grid system 
- **CSS3** - I used CSS3 alongside Bootstrap styles (and sometimes to override Bootstrap styles) to give the website a more personalised look
- **Looka.com** - I used this website to get the logo
- **Unsplash.com** - I used this to get the images for the game
- **Adobe Color** - For the colour scheme 


### HTML and CSS Validation

I used the [W3C HTML Validator tool](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to validate my HTML code

I used the [W3C CSS Validator tool](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) to validate my CSS code

I used https://codebeautify.org/jsvalidate to validate my Javascript code 

### Bugs or Problems

- **Pictures aren't responsive** - Unfortunately the images don't scale properly when game is resized for mobile. I'm less familiar with javascript so couldn't figure out how to do this

## Deployment

I used Github Pages to deploy my website. The process was as follows:
1. I created a branch called "gh-pages" 
2. I merged this with the master branch 
3. I went to the settings and activitated the gh-pages

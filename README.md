My javascript pairs game project 
# My Portfolio - Project One

### About

For this project, I created a javascript pairs game. For this game, the user needs to click on two cards to reveal the images. If the images match, the images will stay on the sreen. If not, the images will disappear, awaiting to be flipped later. When all cards are flipped, the user will recieve an alert saying "you have won the game". 

Not only did I create this game, I also created a user-friendly website for my game. When the user enters the site, there is a simple landing page with a navigation bar that allows them to go to either an instructions page, or straight to playing the game. The landing page includes a logo for the game that I sourced from www.looka.com (listed in acknowledgements). The instruction page provides clear instructions for how to play the game. The user can then click on "play" in the navigation menu to play the game. The navigation menu makes it easy to go between home, instructions page and the game page. 

### Why this project?

This website aims to provide users with an easy game experience where the rules are simple and users can switch off from a long day and also test their memory skills. 

## UX

### Style Rationale 

I wanted to create a website that was bold but also a little quirky (although not too outside of the box).
To create a bold look, I used Adobe Color and searched for a "wine" colour scheme which gave me the deep reds, greys and black. the slanted design, the gradient and the hover effect gave my website some personality and a bit of "me". Originally I wanted a light wood-grain background but settled for the darker color through trial and error. I believe the final product to be a clean, bold but professional look. 

### Features
- **Navigation Bar Logo** - The Logo to the left of the navigation bar is simply to add a bit of interest to the website. This 'logo' has a hover effect and an animation to make it change colour and jump around 
- **Navigation Bar Links** - The links are responsive and take you to the corresponding section. They have a simple hover effect of a white border bottom with a cursor change to allow the user to see clearly where they are clicking and also to let the user know to click the link
- **Landing Page and "download resume" button** - The landing page is a simple picture with a shadow hover effect and a button to download a resume. The button also has an effect where it changes to a grey colour and the letter spacing increases. 
- **About me section with social media links** - This section simply uses a bootstrap card and has social media links at the bottom which link the user to the corresponding social media platforms. The icons have a light colour change hover effect and the cursor changes to a pointer to alert the user that the icons are clickable
- **My Skills Section** - This section is made with icons to outline the technologies I have learnt. 
- **Portfolio Section** - This section is made with bootstrap cards and a shadow hover effect. The cards are clickable although at the moment they link to placeholder websites. 
- **My Experience Section** - This section is made with bootstrap cards and outlines my previous experience
- **My Education Section** - This section is made with bootstrap cards and outlines my previous education
- **Contact Form** - This contact form is responsive and allows the user to share their details and a message. The submit button has a hover effect where the border disappears and the button background turns grey
- **Footer** - The footer has a simple copyright and is coloured with a gradient which matches the colour scheme of the website

### Features Left to Implement

- **Mapbox** - I would like to add a mapbox so people know where I am based.
- **Real portfolio links** - Once I have built up my portfolio I will replace the placeholder pictures/links with real websites


## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - I used HTML5 for many of the basic foundations of my website
- **Bootstrap** - Alongside HTML5, I used Bootstrap classes to create the elements such as cards and navigation bars and to utilise the bootstrap grid system 
- **CSS3** - I used CSS3 alongside Bootstrap styles (and sometimes to override Bootstrap styles) to give the website a more personalised look
- **Formspree** - I used the Formspree API from Formspree.io to get my contact form working


### HTML and CSS Validation

I used the [W3C HTML Validator tool](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to validate my HTML code.

### Interesting Bugs or Problems

- **Contact Form** - Interestingly, the contact form text turns first white and then black and I haven't worked out how to keep the text white. 

## Deployment

I used Github Pages to deploy my website. The process was as follows:
1. I created a branch called "gh-pages" 
2. I merged this with the master branch 
3. I went to the settings and activitated the gh-pages
